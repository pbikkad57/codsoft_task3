Iris flower classification is a common introductory machine learning problem that involves predicting the species of iris flowers based on their features. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers, representing three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
